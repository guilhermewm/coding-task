# Welcome to the app documentation

The structure of the project:
```
|
|- api
|- frontend
|- README.md
```

# Layout

The first step of the development was to draw a mock of the screens to visualize the better way to implement the layout

### Run it

To run the application locally, you have to start both server and frontend application:
1. Navigate to the `api` folder in the terminal and start the server: `npm install && npm run start`
2. (Open `localhost:4000` in the browser to test the GraphQL API)
2. In a different terminal navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `yarn install && yarn start`.
3. Open `localhost:3000 in a browser to see the frontend application.
